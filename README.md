# Python-Projects
This is a list of Python projects you can start and complete easily. There are 3 easy, 2 medium and 2 advance level projects.

Let's start with the easy one.
## Easy Projects
1. Rock, Paper, Scissors game - You can build a simple rock, paper and scissors game using python. This project can be a good place to start your Python journey. This is a simple easy-level game which you can build easily with random module in Python. If you want the source code, you can download it from --> https://github.com/Saarthak-Slathia/Rock-paper-scissors.
You can take it to advance level by adding some more features in it such as scores 1️⃣, converting it into GUI 💻 etc.

2. Random Number Generator - The next project is our Random Number generator. You can do this using the random module in python. The advantages of building this project is that first, it will boost your confidence, and second, it will help you create many more advanced and intermediate projects using this such as ludo, snakes and ladders etc. This is a simple project which you can finish early and you can generate a random number between 1 to 10. you can find the source code here --> https://github.com/Saarthak-Slathia/Random-Number-Generator.
You can use the same logic to create games such as ludo, snakes & ladders etc.

3. Text-based Adventure Game - You can create a simple adventure game using conditions in the form of text, for example - if you have asked google assistant in android devices to play games, it plays a text-based game. Similarly, you can create a mini adventure text based game which takes input from the user and responds in according to that. 
See example here --> https://github.com/Saarthak-Slathia/Rescue-from-the-Ofendasaurus.
You can similarly create other examples of such Text-based Adventure Games and it can help you in developing logic and do better with conditions. Also, you can make it more and more advanced day-by-day and little-by-little and the end result after 30-45 days will be that you will get a really advanced game. You can add more features such as voice input 🎙 and speech 🗣 etc.
