# Python-Projects
This is a list of Python projects you can start and complete easily. There are 3 easy, 2 medium and 2 advance level projects.

Let's start with the easy one.
## Easy Projects
1. Rock, Paper, Scissors game - You can build a simple rock, paper and scissors game using python. This project can be a good place to start your Python journey. This is a simple easy-level game which you can build easily with random module in Python. If you want the source code, you can download it from --> https://github.com/Saarthak-Slathia/Rock-paper-scissors.
You can take it to advance level by adding some more features in it such as scores 1️⃣, converting it into GUI 💻 etc.

2. Random Number Generator - The next project is our Random Number generator. You can do this using the random module in python. The advantages of building this project is that first, it will boost your confidence, and second, it will help you create many more advanced and intermediate projects using this such as ludo, snakes and ladders etc. This is a simple project which you can finish early and you can generate a random number between 1 to 10. you can find the source code here --> https://github.com/Saarthak-Slathia/Random-Number-Generator.
You can use the same logic to create games such as ludo, snakes & ladders etc.

3. Text-based Adventure Game - You can create a simple adventure game using conditions in the form of text, for example - if you have asked google assistant in android devices to play games, it plays a text-based game. Similarly, you can create a mini adventure text based game which takes input from the user and responds in according to that. 
See example here --> https://github.com/Saarthak-Slathia/Rescue-from-the-Ofendasaurus.
You can similarly create other examples of such Text-based Adventure Games and it can help you in developing logic and do better with conditions. Also, you can make it more and more advanced day-by-day and little-by-little and the end result after 30-45 days will be that you will get a really advanced game. You can add more features such as voice input 🎙 and speech 🗣 etc.

Let's take a look at the 2 intermediate or medium level projects.

## Intermediate Projects
1. Calculater - The first intermediate or medium level project is a GUI 💻 based Calculater 📱 in Python. You can build this in a couple of days and you can take help of Tkinter module in python. Tkinter is a Python package which helps in making GUI's. You can learn more about Tkinter with the help of its documentation --> https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter. 
At first you can add basic functions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, then you can day-by-day increase the number of functions your calculater can perform, make it more-and-more advanced till the point where your calculater has become a professional calculater. Then, you can also improve its design.

2. Currency Converter Application - The second and final project you can make in intermediate python projects is a GUI-based Currency Converter Application. You can start with a basic conversion of Rupees To Dollars or Pounds to Euros etc. Then you can slowly add more and more features in it such as more and more currency conversions. The end result of this will be your beautiful currency conversion application. It is a good place to apply your python skills and create an application.

Let's head forward towards the 2 Advanced level Python Projects.

## Advanced Python Projects
1. Covid-19 case detecter - As you know, the Covid-19 pandemic has spread wildfire in the world and people have died and suffered due to this disease. People also have a great headache not only because of the disease but also by searching how many new Covid-19 cases have been found in a day. You can create a Python project for the same which fetches data using a Covid-19 API and displays it to the user. You can create this project using Django or Flask. you can begin with little data such as number of new cases detected in a day and then take it to another level by displaying more data such as number of recovered patients, the number of Active cases, vaccine doses administered etc. This will be a great project to apply your python skills.
